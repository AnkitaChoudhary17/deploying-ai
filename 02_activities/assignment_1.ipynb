            "  \"Summary\": \"In 'Managing Oneself', Peter F. Drucker argues that success in the knowledge economy hinges on individuals' ability to understand their strengths, weaknesses, values, and preferred work styles. He posits that knowledge workers must take responsibility for their own careers, acting as their own CEOs. Drucker outlines a series of introspective questions that individuals should ask themselves to identify their strengths, preferred methods of working, and ethical values. He emphasizes the importance of feedback analysis to accurately assess one's abilities and suggests that individuals focus on enhancing their strengths rather than attempting to improve weaknesses. Drucker also discusses the significance of aligning personal values with organizational values to ensure job satisfaction and effectiveness. He concludes by highlighting the necessity for knowledge workers to manage their careers proactively, especially in a world where traditional career paths are increasingly obsolete. The document serves as a guide for individuals seeking to navigate their professional lives with intention and purpose, particularly in the context of the knowledge economy.\",\n",

            "In \"Managing Oneself,\" Peter F. Drucker argues that success in the knowledge economy depends on individuals' ability to understand their strengths, weaknesses, values, and preferred work styles. He posits that knowledge workers must take responsibility for their own careers, effectively acting as their own CEOs. Drucker outlines a series of introspective questions that individuals should ask themselves to identify their strengths, preferred methods of working, and ethical values. He emphasizes the importance of feedback analysis as a tool for accurately assessing one's abilities and suggests that individuals focus on enhancing their strengths rather than attempting to improve their weaknesses. Additionally, Drucker discusses the significance of aligning personal values with organizational values to ensure job satisfaction and effectiveness. He concludes by highlighting the necessity for knowledge workers to proactively manage their careers, particularly in a world where traditional career paths are increasingly obsolete. This document serves as a guide for individuals seeking to navigate their professional lives with intention and purpose, especially within the context of the knowledge economy.\n"

Coherence and tonality improved slightly, but the summarization score remained unchanged, indicating no meaningful gain in content completeness. The safety score decreased slightly, suggesting the revision introduced less optimal phrasing. Overall, the controls helped maintain stability and refine style but were not sufficient to significantly improve summary quality.
